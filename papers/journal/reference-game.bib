It first approximates this task as a formal mathematical problem. It then presents an implemented algorithm for solving this problem, illustrating its operation on a small example. This algorithm offers one precise interpretation of the intuitive notions of cross-situational learning and the principle of contrast applied between words in an utterance. It robustly learns a homonymous lexicon despite noisy multi-word input, in the presence of referential uncertainty, with no prior knowledge that is specific to the language being learned. Computational simulations demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm and illustrate how algorithms based on cross-situational learning and the principle of contrast might be able to solve lexical-acquisition problems of the size faced by children, under weak, worst-case assumptions about the type and quantity of data available.},

@article{yu2012,
	abstract = {Both adults and young children possess powerful statistical computation capabilities-they can infer the referent of a word from highly ambiguous contexts involving many words and many referents by aggregating cross-situational statistical information across contexts. This ability has been explained by models of hypothesis testing and by models of associative learning. This article describes a series of simulation studies and analyses designed to understand the different learning mechanisms posited by the 2 classes of models and their relation to each other. Variants of a hypothesis-testing model and a simple or dumb associative mechanism were examined under different specifications of information selection, computation, and decision. Critically, these 3 components of the models interact in complex ways. The models illustrate a fundamental tradeoff between amount of data input and powerful computations: With the selection of more information, dumb associative models can mimic the powerful learning that is accomplished by hypothesis-testing models with fewer data. However, because of the interactions among the component parts of the models, the associative model can mimic various hypothesis-testing models, producing the same learning patterns but through different internal components. The simulations argue for the importance of a compositional approach to human statistical learning: the experimental decomposition of the processes that contribute to statistical learning in human learners and models with the internal components that can be evaluated independently and together.
